# Usage
The program creates a database file in the same directory as the application.

Right now I recommend creating a folder to contain the application + database file and using a desktop shortcut to access the program.

In the future I plan to add configuration settings to be able to change the location of the database file, which should allow for users with access to cloud backup services to backup this file while in use.

# Disclaimer
This program was developed and tested solely on a Windows 11 64 bit system. It relies on the Windows API, as such I expect this program to only work on devices running Windows.
